# Pics Project (React Practice)

## Description
- This was built while going through the Udemy course called *Modern React with Redux* by Stephen Grider
- Pics app takes a search term from the user
- The search term from the user is userd to make a request to an outside API and fetch data
- The API returns fetched images that match the users initial search term and shows them to the user in a list
